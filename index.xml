      <description>Research Broadly speaking, I am quite interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working for some problems on matrices over sets of number theoretic interests. During my bachelor and master, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am open for learning other topics.
Publications Muhammad Afifurrahman. Some counting questions for matrix products, accepted to Bulletin of Australian Mathematical Society.</description>

      <description>Some links Here are my English and Indonesian blogs (infrequently updated).
During pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from Research Seminars webpage. In fact, I first knew my (current) doctoral advisor because she organizes the Number Theory Web Seminar that is posted there.
I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, Terence Tao&amp;rsquo;s and Igor Pak&amp;rsquo;s are worth reading.
Also, I often lurk at TVTropes.
