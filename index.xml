      <description>Research Broadly speaking, I am interested in various aspects of discrete mathematics, especially analytic number theory, arithmetic statistics, additive combinatorics and finite fields. My PhD project is centered on arithmetic statistics of algebraic groups. Problems arising from this field often lead to studying distributions of integer or rational solutions to some system of Diophantine equations, with particular focus on analysing the growth of the number of such solutions as their &amp;lsquo;height&amp;rsquo; goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>Special Sessions I gave three separate sessions in Institut Teknologi Bandung (December 2024), Universitas Diponegoro (January 2025), and Universitas Gadjah Mada (February 2025) on preparations for studying graduate mathematics overseas, especially for mathematical research. Tl;dr please do mathematics overseas.&#xA;The slides are available in Bahasa Indonesia.&#xA;Mettamatika Project Mettamatika Project comes from Spearhead Circle, a pop-culture collective based in Indonesia, with backbones from my friends in ITB. The main mission of this project is to produce books that blend mathematical contents with pop culture references.</description>

      <description>Yui Funami, YuruYuri. This was the frontpage picture when this homepage was made, and my friend protested when I replaced it with my real picture&amp;hellip;&#xA;Here are my English and Indonesian blogs (which are infrequently updated). During the pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from Research Seminars webpage. In fact, I first knew my doctoral advisor from the Number Theory Web Seminar she organizes. I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, Terence Tao&amp;rsquo;s and Igor Pak&amp;rsquo;s are worth reading.</description>
