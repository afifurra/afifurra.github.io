      <description>Research Broadly speaking, I am interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working on various problem related to equations of restricted height. During my bachelor and master studies, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am open for learning other topics.

      <description>Mettamatika Project Other links Here are my English and Indonesian blogs (which are infrequently updated).
During pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from Research Seminars webpage. In fact, I first knew my doctoral advisor from the Number Theory Web Seminar that she organizes.
I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, Terence Tao&amp;rsquo;s and Igor Pak&amp;rsquo;s are worth reading.
I started to listen to some worldwide radio at Radio Garden.</description>
