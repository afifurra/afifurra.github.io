### Research

Broadly speaking, I am quite interested in **discrete mathematics**, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working in various problems on matrices over sets of number theoretic interests. During my bachelor and master studies, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am open for learning other topics.

### Publications

- **Muhammad Afifurrahman**. *On the number of different entries in involutory MDS matrices over finite fields of characteristic two*,
AIP Conference Proceedings 2423, 060002 (2021). [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08352).

Other projects coming soon.
