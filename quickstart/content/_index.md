I am **Afif**^, currently a **final-year mathematics PhD student** at University of New South Wales, Australia, supervised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor E. Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/). I am in the postdoctoral job market for 2026 and onwards. 

In shorthand, my PhD project studies arithmetic statistics of multivariate Diophantine equations using techniques from **analytic number theory**. Generally, I am also interested in various parts of discrete mathematics. [Click here for more on my research and education]({{< ref "research.md" >}}).

My CV in pdf is available [via this link](research/2509_CV_Muhammad_Afifurrahman.pdf).

I also tutored some classes in UNSW. In addition, I am also involved in several mathematical outreach activities, for example,

writing moe-fied mathematical books. Further information on these can be found [here]({{< ref "other.md" >}}).

I came from [Banjarmasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarmasin), South Kalimantan, **Indonesia**. I am a native in Bahasa Indonesia and [Basa Banjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarese_language), and could speak English and Python. 

**Address**: School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia

**News**: I will attend Heidelberg Laureate Forum 2025 as Young Researcher.

^Muhammad is also fine, especially for non-Indonesians. Most Indonesians, including myself, do not have proper first-last name convention. See [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#Indonesian_naming_traditions) on this practice.
