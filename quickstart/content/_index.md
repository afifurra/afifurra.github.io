I am **Afif**^, currently a **final-year mathematics PhD student** at University of New South Wales, Australia, supervised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor E. Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/). 

In shorthand, I am interested in various aspects of number theory and combinatorics. In particular, my PhD project studies arithmetic statistics of algebraic groups using techniques from **analytic number theory**. [Click here for more on my research and education]({{< ref "research.md" >}}).
 
My CV in pdf is available [via this link](research/2602_CV_Muhammad_Afifurrahman.pdf). 
Here are the links to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SnRXYlcAAAAJ&hl=en), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7400-320X) and [zbMath](https://zbmath.org/authors/afifurrahman.muhammad) profiles. My Erdős number is 3.


I also tutored some classes in UNSW. In addition, I am also involved in several mathematical outreach activities, for example,

writing moe-fied mathematical books. Further information on these can be found [here]({{< ref "other.md" >}}).

I came from [Banjarmasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarmasin), South Kalimantan, **Indonesia**. I am a native in Bahasa Indonesia and [Basa Banjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarese_language), and could speak English and Python. 


**News**:

^Muhammad is also fine, especially for non-Indonesians. Most Indonesians, including myself, do not have proper first-last name convention. See [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#Indonesian_naming_traditions) on this practice.
