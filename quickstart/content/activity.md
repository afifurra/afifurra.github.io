### Reading Groups
With [Laurence Petrus Wijaya](https://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/laurence-wijaya), I coordinate reading groups on mathematical papers in Bahasa Indonesia from 2023. The groups consisted of at most 5 students in each term, and each term explores different papers, as follows (chronologically):
- D. Larsen, ‘Bertrand's Postulate for Carmichael Numbers’, Int. Math. Res. Not., **15** (2023) 13072–13098. [2023]
- M. Rudnev and S. Stevens, 'An update on the sum-product problem', Math. Proc. Camb., **173** (2023) 411-430. [2023]
- D. Conlon, J. Fox and Y. Zhao, 'A relative Szemerédi theorem', GAFA **25** (2015), 733-762. [2023]
- T. Tao and T. Ziegler, 'Infinite partial sumsets in the primes', J. Anal. Math. **151** (1) (2023), 375-389 [February-May 2024]
- M. Bhargava, ‘Galois groups of random integer polynomials and van der Waerden’s Conjecture’, Ann. of Math. 201 (2) (2025), 339–377 [August-November 2024]
- T. F. Bloom and O. Sisask, ‘The Kelley–Meka bounds for sets free of three-term arithmetic progressions’, Essential Number Theory 2 (1) (2023), 15–44. [January-March 2026]

We also helped HIMATIKA ITB, the union of mathematics students in ITB, to moderate a reading group on `Proofs from THE BOOK' on August-September 2025.
