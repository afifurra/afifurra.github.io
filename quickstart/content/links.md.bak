Yui Funami, YuruYuri. This was the frontpage picture for a long time, and when I changed the picture, my friend told me to let Yui stay here.

- Here are my [English](https://afurraa.wordpress.com) and [Indonesian](https://mafifapip.wordpress.com) blogs (which are infrequently updated).
- During the pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from [Research Seminars](https://researchseminars.org/) webpage. In fact, I first knew my doctoral advisor from the [Number Theory Web Seminar](https://www.ntwebseminar.org/) she organizes.
- I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, [Terence Tao's](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and [Igor Pak's](https://igorpak.wordpress.com/) are worth reading.
- I started to listen to some worldwide radio channels at [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden). RRI Pro-1 Banjarmasin, in particular, has talkshows in Banjar language.
- [Chrisye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrisye) is a nice start for modern Indonesian music.
