### Research

Broadly speaking, I am quite interested in **discrete mathematics**, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working on various problem related to equations of restricted height. During my bachelor and master studies, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am open for learning other topics.
