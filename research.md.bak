## Research

Broadly speaking, I am interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working on various problem related to equations of restricted height. During my bachelor and master studies, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am open for learning other topics.
