### Research

Broadly speaking, I am quite interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. For my PhD, I am currently working for some problems on matrices over sets of number theoretic interests. During my bachelor and master, I did a total of two final projects on some objects over finite fields. However, I am also open for other topics.
