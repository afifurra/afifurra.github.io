  <h2 id="special-sessions">Special Sessions</h2>
<p>I gave three separate sessions in Institut Teknologi Bandung (December 2024), Universitas Diponegoro (January 2025), and Universitas Gadjah Mada (February 2025) on preparations for studying graduate mathematics overseas, especially for mathematical research. Tl;dr please do mathematics overseas.</p>
<p>The <a href="Slide_Tips_MA.pdf">slides</a> are available in Bahasa Indonesia.</p>
<h2 id="mettamatika-project">Mettamatika Project</h2>
<p>Mettamatika Project comes from <a href="https://spearhead-circle.github.io">Spearhead Circle</a>, a pop-culture collective based in Indonesia, with backbones from my friends in ITB. The main mission of this project is to produce books that blend mathematical contents with pop culture references.</p>
<p>Being a part of the scripwriter team in Mettamatika Project (under nickname Furra), I have made a series of mathematical zines on statistical bias in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ilyh4xTe5r09tT_Ut9Y2RtytxMl45Wuh">Mettamatika vol 0.5</a> (2023), a calculus book for Mettamatika vol. 1 (2024), a zine on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh">June Huh</a> in <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RB05DiXYXlKIfnqJ4jQB5fKyw1IhOi9Q">Mettamatika vol 1.5</a> (2024), a statistics book for Mettamatika vol. 2 (2025), a zine on job prospect of mathematical majors (2025) and a linear algebra book for Mettamatika vol. 3 (2026). All materials are in Bahasa Indonesia.</p>

<img src="/img/Metmat2.png" alt="B1"></p>
<p>The books are mainly sold at Comic Frontier, the largest Indonesian pop culture market, held twice a year. I have helped the Spearhead Circle <del>and cosplayed as <a href="https://https://myanimelist.net/character/185313/Aquamarine_Hoshino">Aqua Hoshino</a> and <a href="https://www.sekaipedia.org/wiki/Kamishiro_Rui">Rui Kamishiro</a> while giving copies of my article</del> during the 20th edition in May 2025.</p>
<p>I have also given a talk on this project during the Visualisation, Mathematical Art, Engagement and Outreach at AustMS Annual Meeting 2025&hellip; in a cosplay. Pics to be shared later when I feel like it.</p>
<h2 id="morfid">morfID</h2>
<p>With several of my Indonesian colleagues, we build <a href="https://morfidmath.wordpress.com/">morfID</a>, a blog that caters undergraduate mathematical courses in Bahasa Indonesia. Besides founding and handling technicals of the blog, I am currently working on the <a href="https://morfidmath.wordpress.com/category/kombinatorika-enumeratif/">Ennumerative Combinatorics</a> and Elementary Number Theory course.</p>
<p><img src="/img/morfid.png" alt="B"></p>
<h2 id="podcast-bebas-linear">Podcast Bebas Linear</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1gSCPVgcEpbSNptCb88evE">Podcast Bebas Linear</a> is a long-running mathematical podcast in Bahasa Indonesia, founded by Muhammad Rizki Fadillah and <a href="https://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/laurence-wijaya">Laurence Petrus Wijaya</a>, two of my friends from my time in ITB
The podcast covers various mathematical topics, including explanations of mathematical theorems, biographies of mathematicians, history of parts of mathematics and interviews with Indonesian mathematics students and academics. I have been a guest host since 2020 and a permanent host since March 2025.</p>
<h2 id="other-media-appearances">Other Media Appearances</h2>
<ul>
<li>I gave <a href="https://rhed.amsi.org.au/muhammad-afifurrahman/">an interview</a> in 2023 as an AMSI Grant Awardee.</li>
<li>I also appeared in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@shofiaishar">PhD friend</a>&rsquo;s YouTube podcasts in 2024. Here are the links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRiERUbLwi8">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWQ4Lf4JUjI">part 2</a>, both in Bahasa Indonesia.</li>
<li>I was invited for a radio talk in RRI Pro 1 Banjarmasin in January 2025. The recording can be accessed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXDUvTipsYY">here</a>, in Bahasa Indonesia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indonesian-phd-student-in-unsw">Indonesian PhD Student in UNSW</h2>
<p>I was formerly the coordinator of the Community of Indonesian PhD students in UNSW, from June 2023 to December 2024. Outside Indonesia, UNSW probably has the largest number of Indonesian PhD students, with 150+ members (as of November 2025) in the chatgroups from varied backgrounds. I could estimate that in any given recent time, there are 60+ Indonesian PhD students enrolled in the campus.</p>

<h2 id="mathematical-olympiad">Mathematical Olympiad</h2>
<p>I have been active in mathematical olympiads as a participant since elementary school. Currently, whenever I am elgible, I also help arranging (mostly marking) the selection tests for the Indonesian IMO team.
I sometimes propose problems for OSN Matematika, the major national Indonesian mathematical olympiads and part of selections for the IMO Team.</p>
<p>Outsides of national selections, I also propose problems for <a href="ktom-tomi.or.id">KTO Matematika</a>, an Indonesian nonprofit mathematical olympiad community founded by Indonesian mathematical olympiad alumni. I was also formerly their head of social media from 2016-2018.</p>
<h3 id="selected-other-activities">Selected Other Activities</h3>
<ul>
