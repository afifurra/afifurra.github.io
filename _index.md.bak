I am **Afif**^, currently a **second-year mathematics PhD student** at University of New South Wales, Australia, advised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor E. Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/).

Broadly speaking, I am interested in **discrete mathematics**, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. [Click here for more on my research and education]({{< ref "research.md" >}}).

I came from [Banjarmasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarmasin), South Kalimantan, **Indonesia**. I am a native in Bahasa Indonesia and [Basa Banjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarese_language), and could speak English and Python. 

Outside progressing with my PhD research, I also have other interests, for example...

writing moe-fied mathematical books. Further information on these books can be found [here]({{< ref "other.md" >}}).

**Address**: School of Mathematics and Statistics, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia 

**Email**: m dot afifurrahman at unsw dot edu dot au

**CV**: pdf coming soon.

^Muhammad is also fine, especially for non-Indonesians. Most Indonesians, including myself, do not have proper first-last name convention. See [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#Indonesian_naming_traditions) on this practice.
