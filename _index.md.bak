I am **Afif**^, currently a **third-year mathematics PhD student** at University of New South Wales, Australia, advised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor E. Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/). I am expecting to finish my degree at the beginning of 2026.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in **discrete mathematics**, especially analytic **number theory**, combinatorics, and finite fields. [Click here for more on my research and education]({{< ref "research.md" >}}).

My CV in pdf is available [via this link](research/CV2411_MuhammadAfifurrahman.pdf).

Outside progressing with my PhD research, I also have other interests,

for example, writing moe-fied mathematical books. Further information on these books can be found [here]({{< ref "other.md" >}}).

I came from [Banjarmasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarmasin), South Kalimantan, **Indonesia**. I am a native in Bahasa Indonesia and [Basa Banjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarese_language), and could speak English and Python.

^Muhammad is also fine, especially for non-Indonesians. Most Indonesians, including myself, do not have proper first-last name convention. See [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#Indonesian_naming_traditions) on this practice.
