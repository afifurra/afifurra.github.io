I am currently a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. I am fortunate to be advised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/).

Previously I graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology in Bandung, Indonesia, with a BSc in Mathematics at 2020 and MSc in Mathematics at 2021. I was supervised by [Aleams Barra](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/aleams-barra) (also well-known for [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bermatematikacom))
