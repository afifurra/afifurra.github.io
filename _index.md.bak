I am currently a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at University of New South Wales, advised by Alina Ostafe and Igor Shparlinski.

Roughly speaking, I am quite interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields.

Here are my [English](https://afurraa.wordpress.com) and [Indonesian](https://mafifapip.wordpress.com) blogs (_infrequently updated_).
