***(i have not been able to find a decent profile picture yet)***

I am currently a second-year PhD student in Mathematics at University of New South Wales, Australia, advised by [Alina Ostafe](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~alinaostafe/) and [Igor Shparlinski](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~igorshparlinski/)

Broadly speaking, I am quite interested in discrete mathematics, especially number theory, combinatorics, and finite fields. 

Before doing my PhD, I studied in Institut Teknologi Bandung, Indonesia, advised by [Aleams Barra](https://www.itb.ac.id/staf/profil/aleams-barra). 

I came from [Banjarmasin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarmasin), South Kalimantan, Indonesia. I am a native in Bahasa Indonesia and [Basa Banjar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjarese_language), and could speak English and Python. Some of my hobbies are wandering on public transport, trying to read Indonesian literature works, and doing some things related to anime.

Here are my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SnRXYlcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7400-320X) profiles.

Btw, just call me Afif. Muhammad is also fine, especially for non-Indonesians. Most Indonesians, including myself, do not have proper first-last name convention. See [this Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_names#Indonesian_naming_traditions) on this practice.
