## Mettamatika Project
Mettamatika Project comes from [Spearhead Circle](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089620167900), a pop-culture collective based in Indonesia, with backbones from my friends in ITB. The main mission of Mettamatika is giving books that blend mathematical contents with pop cultures. 

Being a part of the scripwriter team in Mettamatika Project (under nickname Furra), I have made a series of mathematical zines on statistical bias in [Mettamatika vol 0.5](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ilyh4xTe5r09tT_Ut9Y2RtytxMl45Wuh) (2023), a calculus book for Mettamatika vol. 1 (2024), a zine on [June Huh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Huh) in [Mettamatika vol 1.5](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RB05DiXYXlKIfnqJ4jQB5fKyw1IhOi9Q) (2024), and a statistics book for Mettamatika vol. 2(2025). All materials are in Bahasa Indonesia.

## morfID
With several of my Indonesian colleagues, we build [morfID](https://morfidmath.wordpress.com/), a blog that caters undergraduate mathematical courses in Bahasa Indonesia. Besides founding and handling technicals of the blog, I am currently working on the [Ennumerative Combinatorics](https://morfidmath.wordpress.com/category/kombinatorika-enumeratif/) course.

## Podcast Bebas Linear
[Podcast Bebas Linear](https://open.spotify.com/show/1gSCPVgcEpbSNptCb88evE) is a long-running mathematical podcast in Bahasa Indonesia, created and hosted by Muhammad Rizki Fadillah and [Laurence Petrus Wijaya](https://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/laurence-wijaya), two of my friends from my time in ITB. Both are currently PhD students in UAE and USA.
The podcast covers various mathematical topics, including  explanations of mathematical theorems, biographies of mathematicians, history of parts of mathematics and interviews with Indonesian mathematics students and academics.

I have been invited to eight of their podcasts episodes, as follows:\

## Indonesian PhD Student in UNSW
I was formerly the coordinator of the Community of Indonesian PhD students in UNSW, from June 2023 to December 2024. Outside Indonesia, UNSW probably has the largest number of Indonesian PhD students, with 120+ members (as of December 2024) from varied backgrounds in the corresponding chatgroups.

## Mathematical Olympiad
I have been active in mathematical olympiads as a participant since elementary school. Currently, whenever I am elgible, I also help arranging (mostly marking) the selection tests for the Indonesian IMO team.
I sometimes propose problems for OSN Matematika, the major national Indonesian mathematical olympiads and part of selections for the IMO Team.

Outsides of national selections, I also propose problems for [KTO Matematika](ktom-tomi.or.id), an Indonesian nonprofit mathematical olympiad community founded by Indonesian mathematical olympiad alumni. I was also formerly their head of social media from 2016-2018.

### Selected Other Activities
- I gave [an interview](https://rhed.amsi.org.au/muhammad-afifurrahman/) as an AMSI Grant Awardee.
- I also appeared in my [PhD friend](https://www.youtube.com/@shofiaishar)'s YouTube podcasts. Here are the links to [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRiERUbLwi8) and [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWQ4Lf4JUjI), both in Bahasa Indonesia. Note that this podcast is oriented for general Indonesian audiences.
