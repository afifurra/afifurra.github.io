## Mettamatika Project
Mettamatika Project comes from [Spearhead Circle](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089620167900), a pop-culture collective based in Indonesia, with backbones from my friends in ITB. The main mission of Mettamatika is giving books that blend mathematical contents with pop cultures. 

Being a part of the scripwriter team in Mettamatika Project (under nickname Furra), I have made a series of mathematical zines in [Mettamatika vol 0.5](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ilyh4xTe5r09tT_Ut9Y2RtytxMl45Wuh) (2023), and a calculus book for Mettamatika vol. 1 (2024). The materials are in Bahasa Indonesia, though.

Further projects from this collective are expected in November 2024 and mid-2025.

## Podcast Bebas Linear
[Podcast Bebas Linear](https://open.spotify.com/show/1gSCPVgcEpbSNptCb88evE) is a long-running mathematical podcast in Bahasa Indonesia, created and hosted by Muhammad Rizki Fadillah and [Laurence Petrus Wijaya](https://sites.google.com/g.uky.edu/laurence-wijaya), two of my friends from my time in ITB. Both are currently PhD students in UAE and USA.
The podcast covers various mathematical topics, including  explanations of mathematical theorems, biographies of mathematicians, history of parts of mathematics and interviews with Indonesian mathematics students and academics.

I have been invited to eight of their podcasts episodes, as follows:
- #161 - Doing PhD in UNSW, expected to be released in June 2024
- [#132](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1gVK7BbfplhtGGmGxxfMxt) - Serba-serbi Daftar Kuliah di Luar Negeri (Shenanigans of Overseas Universities Admissions), May 2023.
- [#131.5](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QXqLoBnZgjfD7nwJwxQpa) - Masalah Pendidikan Matematika di Indonesia (Problems in Mathematical Education in Indonesia), May 2023
- [#101](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7f8W7l6oIX71oW0yIBa0cu) - Bermatematika sampai ke Amerika bersama [Eunice Sukarto](https://www.math.harvard.edu/people/sukarto-eunice) (Doing Math in America, with Eunice), May 2022.
- [#64](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VFcEXSw8bESUJT7lweXrJ) - Afif[u] Appreciation Episode, July 2021.
- [#59](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3OWyR2FmD7Bo8S137zjk8O) - Catatan Hati Seorang Grader (Laments of a [Mathematical Exam] Grader), June 2021.
- [#58](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5eaXYqkd0AozJ1x3Rj3YY0) - Dos and Don'ts in Doing Math, May 2021.
- [#23](https://open.spotify.com/episode/07Vj5ejkheOsVuZWRCWsHY) - Bermatematika Ria di Bulgaria (Doing Mathematics in Bulgaria), July 2020.

## Community of Indonesian PhD Student at UNSW
I have been the coordinator of the community of Indonesian PhD students at UNSW since 2023. My main tasks are including arranging welcoming events for new batches of PhD students (pics to be added later).

## Mathematical Olympiad
I have been active in mathematical olympiads as a participant since elementary school. Currently, whenever I am elgible, I also help arranging (mostly marking) the selection tests for the Indonesian IMO team.
I sometimes propose problems for OSN Matematika, the major national Indonesian mathematical olympiads and part of selections for the IMO Team. I will share my works in the next iterations of this web.

Outsides of national selections, I also propose problems for [KTO Matematika](ktom-tomi.or.id), an Indonesian nonprofit mathematical olympiad community founded by Indonesian olympiad alumni. I was also formerly their head of social media from 2016-2018.

### Selected Other Activities
