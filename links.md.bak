### Some links
- Here are my [English](https://afurraa.wordpress.com) and [Indonesian](https://mafifapip.wordpress.com) blogs (_infrequently updated_).

- During pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from [Research Seminars](https://researchseminars.org/) webpage. In fact, I first knew my (current) doctoral advisor because she organizes the [Number Theory Web Seminar](https://www.ntwebseminar.org/) that is posted there.

- I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, [Terence Tao's](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and [Igor Pak's](https://igorpak.wordpress.com/) are worth reading.

- Also, I often lurk at [TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org).
