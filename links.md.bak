### Other links
- Here are my [English](https://afurraa.wordpress.com) and [Indonesian](https://mafifapip.wordpress.com) blogs (_infrequently updated_).

- During pandemic, I often crash into some online mathematical research seminars from [Research Seminars](https://researchseminars.org/) webpage. In fact, I first knew my (current) doctoral advisor because she organizes the [Number Theory Web Seminar](https://www.ntwebseminar.org/) that is posted there.

- I like binge-reading mathematical blogs; in particular, [Terence Tao's](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/) and [Igor Pak's](https://igorpak.wordpress.com/) are worth reading.

- I started to listen to some worldwide radio at [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden). RRI Pro-1 Banjarmasin, in particular, has talkshows in Banjar language.

- [Chrisye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrisye) is a nice start if one wants to know how modern Indonesian music sounds like.
